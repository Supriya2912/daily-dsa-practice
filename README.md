# 📘 Daily DSA Practice

This repository contains my **daily practice of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** to strengthen problem-solving skills and coding fundamentals required for **Software Engineering roles**.

I consistently solve problems from platforms like **LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, and HackerRank**, focusing on:
- Clear logic
- Optimized solutions
- Readable and well-commented code
